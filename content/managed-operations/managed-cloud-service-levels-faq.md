service levels.

#### What are the service levels for Managed Public OpenStack Cloud?

Managed Public OpenStack Cloud has two service levels: Managed Infrastructure
and Managed Operations.

-   **Managed Infrastructure**: Rackspace manages the data center,
    infrastructure, and virtualization layers.
-   **Managed Operations**: Rackspace manages the data center, infrastructure,
    virtualization layers, operating system, database layer, and web server.

#### Can new customers choose other service levels for Managed Public OpenStack Cloud?

Operations. Customers with a previous pricing model can stay on that model or

current pricing plan and continue to receive the same support as always, along
with any enhancements we announce.
