Get quick answers to common questions about the Managed Public OpenStack Cloud service levels.

#### What are the service levels for Managed Public OpenStack Cloud?

Managed Public OpenStack Cloud has two service levels: Managed Infrastructure and Managed Operations.

-   **Managed Infrastructure**: Rackspace manages the data center, infrastructure, and virtualization layers.
-   **Managed Operations**: Rackspace manages the data center, infrastructure, virtualization layers, operating system, database layer, and web server.

#### Can new customers choose other service levels for Managed Public OpenStack Cloud?

No, new customers can choose *only* between Managed Infrastructure or Managed Operations. Customers with a previous pricing model can stay on that model or may choose to move to the new pricing model. Customers cannot return to the old model after they upgrade to another service level.

#### What happens with customers who are on the old Infrastructure service level?

Customers who have the Infrastructure service level are grandfathered into their current pricing plan and continue to receive the same support as always, along with any enhancements we announce.

#### Do Managed Operations customers get additional services?

Yes, customers at the Managed Operations service level can take advantage of the following additional services:

-   Platform maintenance
-   Cloud app installation
-   Monitoring and response
-   Cloud app service management
-   Named account manager

#### What support guarantees do customers receive with Managed Cloud?

**Support SLA**: A service level agreement (SLA) that covers support circumstances within our control.

-   *Credit percentage*: Standard rate is 5 percent per every 30 minutes of downtime, up to 100 percent of cloud monthly spend.

**2x SLA Accelerator Credit percentage**: For *Managed Operations* service level customers, we double the credit percentage of all applicable SLA violations.

-   *Credit percentage*: 2x up to 100 percent of cloud monthly spend. For example, if the standard payout is 5 percent per 30 minutes of downtime, Managed Operations will be 10 percent per 30 minutes.
-   This 2x accelerator also applies to *Support SLA* credit payouts.

**10x SLA Accelerator Credit Payout for Planned Events for Managed Operations**: This credit has limited availability and is subject to certain restrictions.

-   *Managed Operations* customers who, in preparation for a high traffic event, undergo a Rackspace-led architecture review and meet the minimum requirements are eligible for this SLA.
-   The customer must notify Rackspace at least 30 business days prior to the planned event. We provide recommendations that the customer implements, then the customer signs a program agreement.
-   *Credit payout*: 10x up to 200 percent of monthly spend (up to one event per month). For example, if the standard payout is 5 percent per 30 minutes, it will become 50 percent per 30 minutes up to 200 percent.
