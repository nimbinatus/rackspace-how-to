Get quick answers to common questions about the Managed Public OpenStack Cloud
service levels.

#### What are the service levels for Managed Public OpenStack Cloud?

Managed Public OpenStack Cloud has two service levels: Managed Infrastructure
and Managed Operations.

-   **Managed Infrastructure**: Rackspace manages the data center,
    infrastructure, and virtualization layers.
-   **Managed Operations**: Rackspace manages the data center, infrastructure,
    virtualization layers, operating system, database layer, and web server.

#### What is the service-level pricing model?

The Managed Cloud pricing model provides greater transparency of your total
cloud expense by separating the cost of infrastructure and support.

The infrastructure rate is based on the number of gigabytes (GB) of random
access memory (RAM) used during the billing cycle, and not on the types of
server. This way, many small servers are the same price as fewer larger servers.

The support cost, or Service Level Rate, is determined by the total Compute
power used. The Service Level Rate covers the maintenance and support of all
your cloud Compute products (such as servers), and is based on your service
level. OnMetal servers have a flat hourly rate independent of RAM. If you do not
meet the minimum Service Level Rate during your billing cycle, the difference is
assessed to your account.

Your service level and support cover all products, but the Service Level Rate is
only assessed against Compute products. Storage services such as Cloud Files and
Cloud Block Storage have no Service Level Rates associated with them.

#### Can new customers choose other service levels for Managed Public OpenStack Cloud?

No, new customers can choose *only* between Managed Infrastructure or Managed
Operations. Customers with a previous pricing model can stay on that model or
may choose to move to the new pricing model. Customers cannot return to the old
model after they upgrade to another service level.

#### What happens with customers who are on the old Infrastructure service level?

Customers who have the Infrastructure service level are grandfathered into their
current pricing plan and continue to receive the same support as always, along
with any enhancements we announce.

#### Do Managed Operations customers get additional services?

Yes, customers at the Managed Operations service level can take advantage of the
following additional services:

-   Platform maintenance
-   Cloud app installation
-   Monitoring and response
-   Cloud app service management
-   Named account manager
